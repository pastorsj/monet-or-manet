This repository contains the source code for the [Beyond Image Classification: Leveraging CNNs and Clustering Methods to Provide Informed Artistic Recommendations]() project. The dataset for the project can be downloaded from [wikiart](https://archive.org/download/wikiart-dataset). The dataset was generated by the [WikiArt Crawler](https://github.com/asahi417/wikiart-image-dataset)

## Project Details

The three folders in this repository are Analysis, Models, and Recommendation Engine. 

### Analysis 

The analysis Folder contains the code for the analysis of the dataset. The three python notebooks plot the training and testing losses for pre-trained and predefined models over the 10%, 50%, and 95% subsets of the data. The analysis csvs are generated from the notebooks in the models folder. 

### Models

Python file in the Models folders contains all the models listed in the paper. The models are tested on the 10%, 50%, and 95% subsets of the data. The file, in combination with the model_utils file, was used to generate the analysis csvs.

### Recommendation Engine

Recommendation Engine jupyter notebook utilizes the layer slicing and the model_utils file to generate the recommendations as discussed in the paper.
